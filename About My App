The project is based on employee registration, which involves storing employee information. I used Java as the backend, HTML and CSS for the frontend, and H2 as the database. The application was developed using the Spring MVC concept. The primary purpose of this project is to allow users to register their details, which are then stored in the database. Each user receives a unique ID, enabling editing, deletion, and searching of specific employee details.
